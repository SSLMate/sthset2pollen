sthset2pollen downloads Chromium's latest STHSet and outputs
it in the form of an STH pollen JSON object as described in
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-trans-gossip-04#section-8.2.4>.

It is based on Adam Langley's crlset-tools program
<https://github.com/agl/crlset-tools>.  Many thanks to Graham Edgecombe
<https://www.grahamedgecombe.com/> for explaining to me how STHSets work.
