sthset2pollen downloads Chromium's latest STHSet and outputs
it in the form of an STH pollen JSON object as specified in
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-trans-gossip-00#section-5.2.3>.

The code is based on Adam Langley's crlset-tools
<https://github.com/agl/crlset-tools>.  Many thanks to Graham Edgecombe
<https://www.grahamedgecombe.com/> for explaining to me how STHSets work.
